          I am a self motivated full stack developer who is enthusiast in application development.
          My mind set is well trained to work on a strict and challenging situations.
          <br /> <br /> I started my education at S. Thomas' College Mt.Lavinia
          . After successfully completing the General Certificate Examination Advanced Level, I entered the National Institute of Business Management for my higher education.
          I completed a diploma in computer systems design and a higher diploma in computer-based information systems, as well as a bachelor Degree in Computer Science at NIBM.
          Thereafter, I was offered a position at a reputed  company in Sri Lanka (WSO2) to work as an Assosiate Software Developer.
          After gaining experience, I decided to gather professional qualifications in computer science.
           <br /> <br />
          I took all three levels of the British Computer Society Higher Education Professional Qualification examinations and successfully passed every module.
          Successful completion of the BCS HEQ is equivalent to a British 3-year honors degree in IT. In the meantime, i have successfully completed the NodeJs cerification (JSNSD).         
           Through all these years, my passion for coding and developing web-based applications has never stopped.
          As I kept coding and mastering the JavaScript language, I was able to learn more advanced concepts in the React framework and NodeJs,
          as well as Express and database design with SQL and MongoDB.   <br /><br />
      
          I am fully confident that I am capable of developing any kind of FullStack application using the MERN stack.
          However, I am more focused on learning advanced concepts, algorithms, and design patterns in back-end development enviornment.
          <br /><br />
          This web site reflects the quality of my work in web-based application development.
          Feel free to check the source code to find out my coding fluency by checking on my GIT Hub repo.
